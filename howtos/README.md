# The Dev Box - HowTo 

Howdy Ho! This section will have various How-To that captures sequence of steps that demonstrate, well, ahem, how-to do something.  Should I come across something technical that I might, oh, let's say, repeat someday in the future, I will collect set of steps to document how to repeat this process.

In the future, I hope the pull out some of the more useful How-To documents for inclusion in a web page.

## Background

In creating scripting and programming tutorials, I found that many environments do not include standard set of compilers, scripitng engines, virtual machines (Java, .NET), or common up-to-date GNU or POSIX tools.  For this reason, I started documenting how to get these tools onto your system.

The second part to this, is after documenting a recipee on how to install an enviornment, I may want to craft some scripts or use a system like [Boxen](https://boxen.github.com/) or other system to install a devbox environment.
